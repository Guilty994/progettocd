# Evaluation of compression technique on holographic data using standard codec for image and video

In this repo we aim to implement the workflow proposed in the experimental work *Performance of Standard Codecs and Image Quality Assessment at Different Distances and Perspectives* to give a proper evaluation of CGH (Computer Generated Hologram) generated with differents algorithms. 

# Requirements 

- Windows 10
- Matlab
  - Image Processing Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox

# Usage

- The command ``` setup_environment ``` will generate the workspace and download the datasets.

- The command ``` benchmark ``` will start the benchmarking process on all existing datasets.
