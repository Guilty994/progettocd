# Evaluation of compression technique on holographic data using standard codec for image and video

In this repo we aim to reproduce the experimental work proposed in "Performance of Standard Codecs and Image Quality Assessment at Different Distances and Perspectives" to evaluate CGH (Computer Generated Hologram) generated with differents algorithms.

## To-do list
### Pre-encoding
  - [x] Acquire holographic data
  - [ ] Undestand the data
    - [x]  Grayscale
    - [ ]  RGB
  - [ ]  Reconstruct hologram using a practical reconstruction algorithm (ASM)
  - [ ]  Categorize the data (raw data, processed data, ...)
  - [ ]  Data analysis
   - [ ]  Real
   - [ ]  Imaginary
### Encoding
#### Grayscale
- [X] HEVC/H.265
- [ ] JPEG 2000
- [ ] AV1
- [ ] VP9 (?)
#### RGB
- [ ] HEVC/H.265
- [ ] JPEG 2000
- [ ] AV1
- [ ] VP9 (?)
### Post encoding
- [ ] PSNR
- [ ] CR (?)
