# Evaluation of compression technique on holographic data using standard codec for image and video

In this repo we aim to reproduce the experimental work proposed in "Performance of Standard Codecs and Image Quality Assessment at Different Distances and Perspectives" to evaluate CGH (Computer Generated Hologram) generated with differents algorithms.

# Requirements 

- Windows 10
- Matlab
  - Image Processing Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox

# Usage

- The command ``` setup_environment ``` will generate the workspace and download the datasets.

- To execture the benchmarks the command ``` benchmark ``` can be used.
