# Evaluation of compression technique on holographic data using standard codec for image and video

In this repo we aim to reproduce the experimental work proposed in "Performance of Standard Codecs and Image Quality Assessment at Different Distances and Perspectives" to evaluate CGH (Computer Generated Hologram) generated with differents algorithms. Here we give an implementation of this workflow on Matlab as a starting point for future sperimentation.

# Requirements 

- Windows 10
- Matlab
  - Image Processing Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox

# Usage

- The command ``` setup_environment ``` will generate the workspace and download the datasets.

- The command ``` benchmark ``` will start the benchmarking process on all existing datasets.
